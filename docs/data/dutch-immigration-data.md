## 10. Real-World Testimonials

### Highly Skilled Migrant Experiences

#### Success Stories
> **Reddit 2024**: "HSM visas usually take between 4-6 weeks, but it depends on how busy they are. I've had some take much longer, and some processed really quickly."

> **Reddit 2025**: "The decision period is 90 days so it hasn't gotten to the maximum time yet."

> **Expat Forum**: "Recognized sponsor application took 3 weeks flat. Had my permit card within a month of the job offer."

#### Challenges
> **Reddit 2025**: "Partner visa past the deadline of 6 months got another sticker for 3 months, they still haven't made any decision."

> **Reddit 2024**: "Applied 2 weeks before [another poster] and am still waiting! I have a standard HSM visa and work corporate."

### Partner Visa Experiences

#### Timeline Examples
> **Reddit user**: "We applied after 4 months of dating, had visited each other twice. Got approved in 8 weeks but had to provide extra relationship evidence."

> **Reddit 2024**: "As a US citizen you are not required to have an MVV, and can therefore wait either in the US or in NL while awaiting your visa."

#### Warnings
> **Reddit 2023**: "The IND website & reps are gonna be the most inconsistent source of information. The people who were able to give me the most accurate info was actually my Native home country's embassy IN the Netherlands."

> **Reddit 2022**: "There have been cases where MVV applicants have been asked to leave the country and re-apply. They can interpret travelling to your partner with a tourist visa while waiting for your MVV as fraud."

### Permanent Residence

#### Success Timeline
> **Reddit October 2024**:
> - Application submitted: 12 June 2024
> - Online or by post: by post
> - Applied before/after 5 years: 3 months before
> - Decision made: 18 September 2024
> - Success: YES!

### Horror Stories

#### Rejection After Approval
> **Reddit 2024**: "IND denied my partner visa application for my wife (UK). When I moved here from the US they required my now wife to have bought a house and have a permanent contract for a partner visa."

#### Asylum Family Reunification
> **Refugee Help**: "It currently takes 20 to 24 months. This is because the IND is very behind in processing applications."

> **IND Website**: "You submitted your application for family reunification in October 2024. The IND processes your application in November 2027."
