## The EU-Turkey Association Agreement: The Foundation

### What It Provides

The 1963 Association Agreement between the EU and Turkey creates **special privileges** for Turkish citizens:

> "For Turkish nationals and their family members who come to live or work in the Netherlands, sometimes different and more favorable rules apply compared to regular migrants from outside the EU." — Everaert Advocaten

**Key advantages:**
- **No points system** for self-employed entrepreneurs (unlike other non-EU nationals)
- **No recognized sponsor required** for highly skilled migrant permits
- **Free labor market access after 3 years** (vs. 5 years for others)
- **Lower application fees** across permit types
- **Age requirement 18** (vs. 21) for spouse reunification
- **Family members get independent residence** after 3 years

### The Standstill Clause

> "The EU countries may no longer tighten the conditions for a residence permit for Turkish nationals from that moment on." — All About Expats

This means the Netherlands must apply 1973 rules in many cases, leading to ongoing legal battles.

## The Integration Exam Controversy

### 2022 Changes (Taking Effect 2025)
From BBC Turkish (July 2024):

> "Hollanda, 1 Ocak 2025 tarihinden itibaren süresiz oturma izni talebinde bulunan Türkiye Cumhuriyeti vatandaşlarını dil ve kültür konusunda zorunlu uyum sınavına tabi tutacak."
> 
> (Translation: "From January 1, 2025, the Netherlands will require Turkish citizens applying for permanent residence to take a mandatory language and culture integration exam.")

**Lawyer İsmet Özkara's response:**
> "Bu düzenlemenin yasalara aykırı olduğunu belirterek, konuyu yargıya taşıyacaklarını söylüyor."
> 
> (Translation: "He states this regulation is contrary to law and they will take the matter to court.")

### Court Victories
A local Dutch court ruled that requiring integration exams for Turkish citizens while exempting Australian and Japanese citizens is **discrimination**. The case was awaiting Danıştay (Council of State) confirmation as of mid-2024.

### What's at Stake
> "Süresiz oturum izni ile kalıcı iş sözleşmesi, kredi, konut edinme gibi AB vatandaşlarına tanınan bütün haklardan yararlanılabiliyor."
>
> (Translation: "With permanent residence, you can benefit from all rights granted to EU citizens: permanent job contracts, credit, and housing acquisition.")

Without the permanent permit, Turkish citizens face:
- Short-term rental contracts only
- Difficulty getting bank loans
- Employment contract limitations

## Self-Employment: The Popular but Tricky Path

### The Exemption
> "Turkish nationals who want to start a business in the Netherlands do not have to comply with the point-based system. However, they must... sufficiently substantiate the application with a sound business and financial plan." — Everaert Advocaten

### Real Experience (Reddit, Sept 2024)
> "The association law is great when you want to open up a business which I have an idea even a business plan but it's in horeca which would mean I have to prove very strongly that I have enough skills and experience in horeca that I can get a pass and **seems Netherlands doing their best to reject ppl under association law even for tiny details**." — r/Netherlands user

### RVO Assessment Criteria
Your business must demonstrate:
1. Financial viability
2. Ability to compete in free market
3. Fulfills a need in Netherlands
4. Positive contribution to Dutch economy
5. Won't disrupt labor market

### Processing Time
> "The Turkish self-employment application procedure takes **3-6 months**." — INLS

### The Fee Advantage
> "The fees for the Turkish self-employment application procedure are **€70**." — INLS

Compare this to €1,400+ for regular self-employed permits!

## Ekşi Sözlük: Turkish Forum Insights

### On the Integration Exam
> "3-4 ay maksimum Hollandaca temelini oturtup üstüne bir de çıkmış sorulara çalışırsanız çok rahat geçersiniz. Konuşma ve kültür zorlamadı beni fakat paragraf sorularında kelime bilginiz önemli."
>
> (Translation: "If you spend 3-4 months max on Dutch basics and study past exam questions, you'll pass easily. Speaking and culture didn't challenge me, but vocabulary is important for paragraph questions.")

### On Tourist Visa Struggles
> "Yakın zamanda çoğu Türkiye Cumhuriyeti vatandaşına red verilen vize. Başvuracak olanların bu durumu önemle dikkate alması gerekmektedir. Ben de yeni biten Schengen vizemden sonra Hollanda da işim olduğu için başvurdum ve red yedim. Yakın zamanda red yiyen iş adamı ve profesör bile duydum."
>
> (Translation: "Recently many Turkish citizens are getting rejected. Applicants should take note. After my Schengen visa ended, I applied because I had business in Netherlands and got rejected. I've heard of businessmen and professors getting rejected recently too.")

### Success Story: Appeal Works!
> "Konsolosluğa bu durum ile itiraz ettik eşim ile birlikte. Sonuç olarak tekrar değerlendirip 1 yıl multi'ye çevirdiler."
>
> (Translation: "We appealed to the consulate together with my spouse. As a result, they re-evaluated and converted it to a 1-year multiple entry visa.")

## Personal Immigration Story: Merve's Journey

From a detailed blog interview (2020):

**Background:** Business analyst in Ankara, moved to Eindhoven in 2017 with husband.

### On Making the Decision
> "When I came here, I didn't expect anything because my English was horrible. I didn't know any Dutch and I never thought of doing the same job here because I always thought I needed to first learn Dutch."

### On Integration
> "Within a week of arriving, she joined a yoga studio... She grabbed her yoga mat. Her phone. Opened GoogleMaps. Walked there. Went in. 'I come for yoga class. I will join.' She smiles at me, eyes wide open, and says, 'It was super hard to say that!'"

### On Finding Work
Started working in hospitality despite having a business administration background:
> "At first, the language and standing all day long [were hardest]. She discovered that the kitchen's language was very different from what she had imagined... they could communicate in English, but she needed to understand it in Dutch too because the recipes she'd follow were given in Dutch."

### On Language Learning
Her English teacher eventually told her:
> "Ok Merve, we're done with your English lessons. You need to learn Dutch starting today."

## Discrimination & Social Experiences

### Reddit Perspectives

**On First-Generation Experience:**
> "A lot of people with Turkish heritage have historically not been treated great, and live in areas that are generally not the greatest places to live. Combine that with poverty, and an increase in right wing ideals in the Netherlands and you get a lot of polarisation and little integration." — r/Netherlands

**From a Turkish Woman:**
> "I am a Turkish female also living in the Netherlands. I never experienced discrimination in a bad way but we can not deny that the majority does experience it. I also believe that many will laugh at you but will talk behind your back because discrimination and racism 'is not done'." — r/Netherlands (June 2024)

**On the Social Climate Post-PVV Victory (Nov 2023):**
> "There is a very strong anti-Turk sentiment in the Netherlands. Definitely more than has voted for PVV. I've lived here my whole life, I'm ethnically Turkish." — r/Netherlands

**Counter-perspective:**
> "As I said, we are not all like that. Racism is a real problem, but there are still a lot of good people. I am sure you don't like it when people generalize all Turks, so try not to do so with the Dutch either."

---

## The Academic Perspective

### The Integration Paradox

From academic research (Taylor & Francis, 2020):

> "The Netherlands has a rich history with respect to migration from Turkey. **Official agreements for labour migration brought many low-skilled Turkish citizens to the Netherlands around the 1960s and 1970s**."

The research identifies a paradox: highly-skilled Turkish migrants often experience **less** national belonging despite being better "integrated" by traditional metrics (language, employment, education).

### Second Generation Patterns

From research on second-generation Turkish-Dutch:
- Those living in neighborhoods with high co-ethnic density more likely to emigrate to Turkey
- International migration experiences during childhood affect integration
- Second generation shows strongest resemblance to native Dutch in most domains

---

## Highly Skilled Migrant Path

### The Advantage
> "Turkish nationals who wish to take up employment as highly skilled migrants do not need a so-called recognized sponsor. Both the employer and the employee can file the application." — Everaert Advocaten

### Salary Requirements (2025)
From DYC Legal:
- Regular HSM: ~€5,000-6,000/month gross (varies by age)
- Under 30: Lower threshold applies
- Part-time is allowed if pro-rated salary meets thresholds

### The 30% Ruling Bonus
If eligible, highly skilled migrants can receive **30% of salary tax-free** (now phased to 30/20/10% over time for new applicants).

> "Three years ago, I relocated to the Netherlands with a highly skilled migrant visa, and I am fortunate to be eligible for the 30 percent ruling." — Reddit user

## Family Reunification: The Ping-Pong

### The Process
1. **MVV application** from Turkey
2. **Basic integration exam** (since 2022 for Turkish citizens too)
3. **Document collection** (apostilled documents, translations)
4. **Wait for IND decision** (90 days legal maximum, often longer)
5. **Collect MVV sticker** at embassy
6. **Enter Netherlands within 90 days**
7. **Collect residence permit** from IND

### Common Problems
From Ekşi Sözlük:
> "15 dakika opsiyon verildi, koşarak fotoğraf çektirmeye gittiler. Bu kadar basit bir şeye neden dikkat etmiyoruz bilemiyorum."
>
> (Translation: "They were given 15 minutes and ran to get photos taken. I don't understand why people don't pay attention to such simple things.")

**Key issues:**
- Biometric photo specifications not met
- Missing apostille on documents
- All passport pages not photocopied
- Insufficient financial proof

### Age Requirement Advantage
For Turkish citizens: **18 years old minimum** for spouse
For other nationalities: **21 years old minimum**
