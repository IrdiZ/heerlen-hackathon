# Accessibility Research: Blind & Disabled Immigrants

## The Problem is MASSIVE

### Statistics
- **15% of world population** has a disability (WHO)
- **No official statistics exist** on disabled migrants specifically
- Disproportionate disability rates among asylum seekers due to violence/trauma

### Barriers Blind/Low Vision Immigrants Face

From Human Rights First research (2023):

1. **Cannot read written communications** from immigration agencies
2. **Difficulty navigating government websites** - screen readers often fail
3. **No accessible resources** on how to request accommodations
4. **Cannot read and complete application forms**
5. **Detention facilities deny glasses** - can't see who's speaking in court
6. **Challenge arranging transportation** to appointments
7. **Courthouse navigation** is difficult

### Apps Are Excluding Disabled Migrants

From Texas Tribune (2024) on CBP One app:

> "The app is inaccessible to migrants with a range of disabilities, including those who are **blind, deaf, have mobility issues, and have intellectual disabilities**"

Real cases:
- **Blind man** traveled to border alone, cannot use app at all
- **Woman with facial paralysis** couldn't use facial recognition
- **Child with autism** couldn't use facial recognition software
- **Man with schizophrenia** couldn't manage daily login requirement

### The Quote That Matters

> "If you're disabled, you cannot use this application... **There has to be another way.**"
> — Kate Thorstad, Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center

## Why MigrantAI is the Solution

### Voice-First = Accessible by Design

| Barrier | Traditional Apps | MigrantAI |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Can't read forms | ❌ Excluded | ✅ Voice reads everything |
| Can't navigate websites | ❌ Lost | ✅ Extension + voice guides |
| Can't type | ❌ Stuck | ✅ Voice input |
| Can't see buttons | ❌ Inaccessible | ✅ "Click the blue button on the left" |
| Complex multi-step process | ❌ Overwhelming | ✅ One step at a time, voice-guided |
| Daily app logins | ❌ Impossible alone | ✅ Agent remembers, reminds, helps |

### "Eyes on the Page" = Game Changer for Blind Users

The extension captures what's on screen. The voice agent describes it:
- "You're on the IND application page"
- "There are 5 fields to fill"
- "The first field asks for your passport number"
- "I'll read each field and you tell me the answer"

### Full Context = No Repeated Explanations

Blind users don't have to explain their situation repeatedly:
- Agent already knows their nationality, visa type, saved PII
- Agent knows which step they're on
- Agent understands the current page
- Just says "I'm stuck" → gets immediate, contextual help

## Pitch Angle: Not Just Convenience, It's ACCESS

> "For 15% of the world, government immigration websites are effectively **locked doors**. 
> MigrantAI gives them the key: a voice assistant with eyes on the page."

### Emotional Demo Script

1. "Imagine you're blind, fleeing persecution, alone at the border"
2. "The only way to apply for asylum is an app you cannot see"
3. "What do you do?"
4. [Show MigrantAI] 
5. "You talk. It sees. It guides. Step by step."
6. "That's not a feature. That's a human right."

## Legal Backing

- **Section 508 of Rehabilitation Act**: Federal agencies MUST make technology accessible
- **EU Web Accessibility Directive**: Public sector websites must be accessible
- **UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities**: Access to information is a right

## Competitors Are Failing

- Government websites: Poorly accessible, complex, not screen-reader friendly
- Immigration apps: Visual-first design, exclude disabled users
- Existing chatbots: Text-only, no "eyes" on pages, no voice

## MigrantAI Differentiator

**"Voice AI with eyes"** - specifically designed for those who cannot see the bureaucracy themselves.
