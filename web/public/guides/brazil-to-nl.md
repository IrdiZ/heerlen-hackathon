## Tips for Brazilians
1. **Apostille documents in Brazil** before leaving - much harder to do remotely
2. **Learn basic Dutch** - not required but helps with integration
3. **Join Brazilian communities** - Brasil em Foco, Brasileiros na Holanda
4. **Weather adjustment** - Netherlands is cold and dark in winter, prepare mentally
5. **CPF/CNPJ** - Keep your Brazilian tax registration active for remittances
