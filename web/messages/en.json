        "question": "How do I register at the gemeente?",

      },
      "workPermit": {
        "question": "Do I need a work permit?",

        "question": "Can I register at a temporary address?",
        "answer": "Yes, but the main tenant must give permission. Some landlords don't allow registration (especially in room rentals). Without registration, you can't get a BSN. Make sure your housing contract allows registration before signing."
