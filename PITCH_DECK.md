# Slide 1: The Problem 😱

## Moving to a new country is... a nightmare

```

│  🇧🇷 Lucas, 28, Software Engineer       │
│  Got a job offer in the Netherlands!    │
│                                         │
│  His excitement level:  📈📈📈          │
│                                         │

│                                         │
│  His excitement level:  📉📉📉💀        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **30+ government websites** to navigate
- **Forms in Dutch** (Gefeliciteerd, you don't speak it)
- **Deadlines everywhere** (miss one → start over)
- **Nobody to ask** at 2 AM when you're panicking

# Slide 2: Meet Lucas 🇧🇷

> *"I just got my dream job in Amsterdam!
> Now I need to figure out... everything else."*

**Lucas's todo list:**
1. ~~Get job offer~~ ✅
2. IND application (wait, what's IND?)
3. MVV visa at consulate
4. BSN number (is that a sandwich?)
5. Health insurance (mandatory?!)
6. 30% ruling (free money?? sign me up)
7. Bank account (they want my BSN but I need a bank to get paid to live here to get a BSN...)

**The circular dependency of doom** 🔄
